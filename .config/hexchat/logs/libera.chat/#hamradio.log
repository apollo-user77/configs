Sep 14 12:52:47 <Bugz000>	each element being 20m it means he's still carrying 40m of wire 
Sep 14 12:52:48 <twiclo>	So is he actually "tuning" the antenna?
Sep 14 12:52:50 <twiclo>	I really think he's talking about tuning his radio that the antenna is plugged into
Sep 14 12:53:05 <Brownout>	Bugz000: not each element, the whole length
Sep 14 12:53:53 <Brownout>	twiclo: he's talking about cutting the wire to the correct length to resonate at the desired frequency/wavelength
Sep 14 12:54:07 <N0ZYC>	Bugz000: what did you say you were hauling with huge filter caps?
Sep 14 12:54:08 <twiclo>	Why is he choosing those frequencies specifically?
Sep 14 12:54:17 <twiclo>	Is this so he doesn't have to bother actually tuning the antennas?
Sep 14 12:54:28 <Bugz000>	N0ZYC the VLF station near me 
Sep 14 12:54:34 <Bugz000>	it's mostly demolished now
Sep 14 12:54:38 <twiclo>	Oh he just said why he chose those frequencies. I guess they're sota calling freqs
Sep 14 12:54:57 <Brownout>	twiclo: they're the cw portion of the respective ham radio bands he cited
Sep 14 12:55:21 <twiclo>	Brownout: do you see those white things on the wire? Is he just using those to detach segments of wire so he can switch bands?
Sep 14 12:55:22 <Bugz000>	https://bugz000.co.uk/i/vU8SId6k.png N0ZYC the tuning coils

Sep 14 12:55:40 <twiclo>	Oh man I just need to watch the video. He goes over it
Sep 14 12:55:44 <Bugz000>	https://bugz000.co.uk/i/pmC935NH.png the caps N0ZYC

Sep 14 12:56:03 <Brownout>	twiclo: yes, it's a linked dipole, he can electrically disconnect segments of the antenna without changing its mechanical length

Sep 14 12:56:14 <N0ZYC>	wow
Sep 14 12:56:23 <Bugz000>	was used to talk to submarines iirc
Sep 14 12:56:37 <N0ZYC>	that's typically what they use yes

Sep 14 12:56:50 <twiclo>	Very cool. I just saw him unlink a segment but he doesn't care to change where the new center of the line is. Wouldn't that impact performance having not the center be at the tip of the mast?
Sep 14 12:56:53 <Bugz000>	here's one of the HF masts N0SSH
Sep 14 12:56:55 <Bugz000>	N0ZYC
Sep 14 12:57:09 <N0ZYC>	I thought the antennas for that were horizontal over a large area
Sep 14 12:57:26 <Bugz000>	https://bugz000.co.uk/i/SmuFXvBx.png N0ZYC here's some of the giant pylons in view, the cable was strung up in a W shape with a giant winch station at each end up on the hill (near where the photo was taken) 
Sep 14 12:57:26 <chat>	^ [image/png] (484.5KiB)
Sep 14 12:57:47 <Bugz000>	they operated HF and VLF
Sep 14 12:57:56 <twiclo>	Brownout: Would you recommend a dipole or an end fed?

Sep 14 12:59:24 <N0ZYC>	heh, sentry post
Sep 14 12:59:41 <N0ZYC>	I suppose it's a room with a view
Sep 14 12:59:52 <Bugz000>	terrifying to be up there no doubt haha
Sep 14 12:59:56 <Bugz000>	specially on a windy day
Sep 14 13:00:11 <N0ZYC>	need to give me a fire pole so at least it's fun at the end of the shift
Sep 14 13:00:34 <N0ZYC>	I honestly have no problems with heights
Sep 14 13:01:07 <Brownout>	twiclo: depends of your needs, a dipole is easier to build and self-support on summits, since you can use the wires as support guys for the pole, the efhw is very popular because you don't have to do anything to switch bands
Sep 14 13:01:10 <Bugz000>	ugh, heights i don't mind, i'm terrified of pylons and large trees though... anything that looks large and unstable haha

Sep 14 13:01:51 <N0ZYC>	I recall years ago being up a big pine tree in high winds...  pine's soft, so those *really* sway in the wind.  I bet I was going 5ft back and forth easy
Sep 14 13:02:13 <N0ZYC>	I don't care so much for towers that move
Sep 14 13:02:17 <Bugz000>	pine is actually harder/denser than oak :D but i 100% get what you mean haha 
Sep 14 13:02:28 <Bugz000>	try being up a damn larch....
Sep 14 13:02:31 <N0ZYC>	it bends more when wet
Sep 14 13:02:34 <Bugz000>	same
Sep 14 13:02:43 <N0ZYC>	I mean when the wood's live
Sep 14 13:02:50 <Bugz000>	my wood aint dead yet
Sep 14 13:03:07 <Bugz000>	i used to be a forester/logger N0ZYC :D
Sep 14 13:03:08 <twiclo>	Brownout Why don't you have to do anything to switch bands? Wouldn't you need to retune it?
Sep 14 13:03:19 <N0ZYC>	I've got some good climbing gear now, I don't get to use it all that often
Sep 14 13:03:28 <Bugz000>	been up too many sketchy trees
Sep 14 13:04:02 <N0ZYC>	but there's always someone in the area that needs tower work.  we were supposed to take down a tower last week but he didn't have the tower "cleaned", so we spent our time stripping off anteanns, hardline, etc
Sep 14 13:04:16 <N0ZYC>	we'l be back out again this weekend to take down the tower itself (3 sections)
Sep 14 13:04:37 *	craftxbox is now known as snep
Sep 14 13:04:39 <N0ZYC>	was brutally hot, 95 and sunny, no wind
Sep 14 13:04:45 <N0ZYC>	should be much nicer weather this weekend
Sep 14 13:04:47 <Bugz000>	the worst is larch, there's 3 aspects to timber strength,  1, hang,  2, brittleness,  3, density,      trees pick 2 and lose out on a third 
Sep 14 13:05:08 *	menace (~someone@ppp-93-104-186-17.dynamic.mnet-online.de) has joined
Sep 14 13:05:10 <Bugz000>	so like willow can fold in half and not break but is not dense at all 
Sep 14 13:05:24 *	menace is now known as Deknos
Sep 14 13:05:40 <Brownout>	twiclo: because it resonates on harmonically related bands
Sep 14 13:05:43 <Bugz000>	larch in this measure is 100% brittle and 100% dense and 0% hang, so it bends... bends... then BANG it will crack like a shotgun and it's snapped clean off rofl
Sep 14 13:06:10 <Bugz000>	bad news if you're on the bit that comes out! :p
Sep 14 13:08:10 <Bugz000>	https://bugz000.co.uk/i/lWoFGmjq.jpg N0ZYC a rare photo of me working

Sep 14 13:09:08 <twiclo>	Brownout: That sounds way over my head. Guess I should just keep reading my general license manual
Sep 14 13:09:52 <Bugz000>	N0ZYC would you believe those trees are over 100ft tall? wild 
Sep 14 13:10:49 <Bugz000>	they don't look it from the base but you can see how dense they were planted 
Sep 14 13:13:33 <N0ZYC>	that is rather surprising for their small girth
