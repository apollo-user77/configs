Apr 06 16:33:23 <sh4>	the point of using full disk encryption is that a malignous party can't install a backdoored kernel

Apr 06 16:35:16 <sney>	that would satisfy your use case, as long as the encryption key isn't stored somewhere obviously on /

Apr 06 16:35:46 <Khepra>	the point of FDE is to protect data at rest. to protect the kernel, you need signed kernels and SecureBoot(tm)

Apr 06 16:36:29 <echelon>	hi
Apr 06 16:36:35 <Khepra>	FDE otherwise doesn't protect the kernel. your grub code could be subverted
Apr 06 16:36:46 <echelon>	where do i get a checksum of all the package in a given repository?
Apr 06 16:36:51 *	c10l (~c10l@user/c10l) has joined
Apr 06 16:36:59 <echelon>	i'm trying to get the checksums from http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/
Apr 06 16:37:51 <somiaj>	echelon: why do you need the checksum, apt should already be doing checks

Apr 06 16:39:49 <echelon>	somiaj: i could've sworn there was a text file of all sha checksums
Apr 06 16:39:51 <somiaj>	echelon: I think they are contained in the release files, 'apt-cache show packagename' will give you the checksum of the package.
Apr 06 16:40:05 <somiaj>	I belive this is all included in the relase files, but not exactly sure where
Apr 06 16:40:11 <sney>	I can't think of a reason to even have separate volumes for a portable vm, much less encrypt some and not others
Apr 06 16:41:15 <somiaj>	yea, they are in the release files, I find them all in /var/lib/apt/lists/...., that contains the full list of all the packages from the repo, including their md5sum and sha256 sum
Apr 06 16:41:56 <somiaj>	http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian11.3/non-free/binary-amd64/ they will probably be in those package lists
