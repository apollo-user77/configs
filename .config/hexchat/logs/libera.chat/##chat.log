Sep 14 12:42:27 <jessicara>	yeah healthcare these days really takes a team effort
Sep 14 12:42:29 <yuken>	blkshp, the entire point of carrying any of this stuff is that emergency services can be 5 to 50 minutes away.
Sep 14 12:42:49 <blkshp>	I have a small Tesco first aid kit and some ibuprofen and codeine.

Sep 14 12:44:18 <yuken>	If it were legal/available I'd probably add some morphine there.
Sep 14 12:44:20 <blkshp>	or 500mb paracetamol (acitemondiekngfmdskwt or whatever you called it) and 8mb codeine

Sep 14 13:01:02 <dumptrucktaco>	We have too many morons who abuse drugs that our government is doing it for their own safety
Sep 14 13:01:30 <dumptrucktaco>	it's seems weird to me the differences in what's approved in US versus EU
Sep 14 13:01:42 <dumptrucktaco>	You'd think they'd be on the same page
Sep 14 13:01:42 <blkshp>	yeah it is strange.
Sep 14 13:01:45 <Vultyre>	it's mostly arbitrary to be honest
Sep 14 13:01:48 <yuken>	dumptrucktaco, yeah. I'd like to be able to just, get OTC codeine, it seems useful.
Sep 14 13:01:53 <yuken>	but too many people abused it so.
