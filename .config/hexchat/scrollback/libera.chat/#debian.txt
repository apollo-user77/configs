T 1649277316 18<sney18>	that would satisfy your use case, as long as the encryption key isn't stored somewhere obviously on /

T 1649277346 18<Khepra18>	the point of FDE is to protect data at rest. to protect the kernel, you need signed kernels and SecureBoot(tm)

T 1649277395 18<Khepra18>	FDE otherwise doesn't protect the kernel. your grub code could be subverted

T 1649277471 18<somiaj18>	echelon: why do you need the checksum, apt should already be doing checks

T 1649277591 18<somiaj18>	echelon: I think they are contained in the release files, 'apt-cache show packagename' will give you the checksum of the package.
T 1649277605 18<somiaj18>	I belive this is all included in the relase files, but not exactly sure where
T 1649277611 18<sney18>	I can't think of a reason to even have separate volumes for a portable vm, much less encrypt some and not others
T 1649277675 18<somiaj18>	yea, they are in the release files, I find them all in /var/lib/apt/lists/...., that contains the full list of all the packages from the repo, including their md5sum and sha256 sum
T 1649277716 18<somiaj18>	http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian11.3/non-free/binary-amd64/ they will probably be in those package lists
