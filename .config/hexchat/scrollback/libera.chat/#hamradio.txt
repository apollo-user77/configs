T 1631638367 18<Bugz00018>	each element being 20m it means he's still carrying 40m of wire 
T 1631638368 18<twiclo18>	So is he actually "tuning" the antenna?
T 1631638370 18<twiclo18>	I really think he's talking about tuning his radio that the antenna is plugged into
T 1631638385 18<Brownout18>	Bugz000: not each element, the whole length
T 1631638433 18<Brownout18>	twiclo: he's talking about cutting the wire to the correct length to resonate at the desired frequency/wavelength
T 1631638447 18<N0ZYC18>	Bugz000: what did you say you were hauling with huge filter caps?
T 1631638448 18<twiclo18>	Why is he choosing those frequencies specifically?
T 1631638457 18<twiclo18>	Is this so he doesn't have to bother actually tuning the antennas?

T 1631638478 18<twiclo18>	Oh he just said why he chose those frequencies. I guess they're sota calling freqs
T 1631638497 18<Brownout18>	twiclo: they're the cw portion of the respective ham radio bands he cited
T 1631638521 18<twiclo18>	Brownout: do you see those white things on the wire? Is he just using those to detach segments of wire so he can switch bands?

T 1631638610 18<twiclo18>	Very cool. I just saw him unlink a segment but he doesn't care to change where the new center of the line is. Wouldn't that impact performance having not the center be at the tip of the mast?

T 1631638781 18<N0ZYC18>	I suppose it's a room with a view
T 1631638792 18<Bugz00018>	terrifying to be up there no doubt haha

T 1631638811 18<N0ZYC18>	need to give me a fire pole so at least it's fun at the end of the shift
T 1631638834 18<N0ZYC18>	I honestly have no problems with heights
T 1631638867 18<Brownout18>	twiclo: depends of your needs, a dipole is easier to build and self-support on summits, since you can use the wires as support guys for the pole, the efhw is very popular because you don't have to do anything to switch bands
T 1631638870 18<Bugz00018>	ugh, heights i don't mind, i'm terrified of pylons and large trees though... anything that looks large and unstable haha

T 1631638911 18<N0ZYC18>	I recall years ago being up a big pine tree in high winds...  pine's soft, so those *really* sway in the wind.  I bet I was going 5ft back and forth easy
T 1631638933 18<N0ZYC18>	I don't care so much for towers that move

T 1631638999 18<N0ZYC18>	I've got some good climbing gear now, I don't get to use it all that often
T 1631639008 18<Bugz00018>	been up too many sketchy trees
T 1631639042 18<N0ZYC18>	but there's always someone in the area that needs tower work.  we were supposed to take down a tower last week but he didn't have the tower "cleaned", so we spent our time stripping off anteanns, hardline, etc
T 1631639056 18<N0ZYC18>	we'l be back out again this weekend to take down the tower itself (3 sections)

T 1631639087 18<Bugz00018>	the worst is larch, there's 3 aspects to timber strength,  1, hang,  2, brittleness,  3, density,      trees pick 2 and lose out on a third

T 1631639143 18<Bugz00018>	larch in this measure is 100% brittle and 100% dense and 0% hang, so it bends... bends... then BANG it will crack like a shotgun and it's snapped clean off rofl
